# FridayProject4Sub
This repository contains the Friday projects we have done for the semester refined through ChatGPT 3.5.

For Proj-1ChatGPT, here is a list of notes regarding the code created by ChatGPT:

Mad Lib Template: The madlib_template variable now reflects the new story template with placeholders for the provided words.

User Input: The input() function is used to get user input for each of the required words.

Format the Mad Lib: The format() method is used to substitute the placeholders in the madlib_template with the user input.

Display the Mad Lib: Finally, the completed Mad Lib story is printed to the console.

When you run this code, it will prompt the user to enter words for the Mad Lib, and then it will display the completed Mad Lib story based on the provided template.
