# FridayProject4Sub
This repository contains the Friday projects we have done for the semester refined through ChatGPT 3.5.

For Proj-1ChatGPT, here is a list of notes regarding the code created by ChatGPT:

Mad Lib Template: The madlib_template variable now reflects the new story template with placeholders for the provided words.

User Input: The input() function is used to get user input for each of the required words.

Format the Mad Lib: The format() method is used to substitute the placeholders in the madlib_template with the user input.

Display the Mad Lib: Finally, the completed Mad Lib story is printed to the console.

When you run this code, it will prompt the user to enter words for the Mad Lib, and then it will display the completed Mad Lib story based on the provided template.

For Proj-2ChatGPT, here is a list of notes regarding the code created by ChatGPT:

Import the random module for generating random numbers.

The random module in Python provides functions for generating random numbers. It's imported to use its randint function for generating PowerBall numbers.
Define a function generate_powerball_numbers for generating PowerBall numbers.

This function encapsulates the logic for generating a set of PowerBall numbers, including the first five regular numbers and the PowerBall number.
Use list comprehension to generate the first 5 random numbers between 1 and 69.

List comprehension is employed to generate a list of five random numbers between 1 and 69, representing the regular numbers in PowerBall.
Generate a random number between 1 and 26 for the PowerBall.

The randint function from the random module is used to generate a random number between 1 and 26, representing the PowerBall number.
Combine the generated numbers into a string with appropriate spacing.

The regular numbers are joined into a string with spaces between them, and four additional spaces are added before appending the PowerBall number. This ensures the specified formatting.
Prompt the user for input, asking if they want PowerBall numbers.

The input function is used to interact with the user, asking whether they would like to receive PowerBall numbers.
Convert the user input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

The user's input is converted to lowercase using the lower method to ensure case-insensitive handling of the response.
If the user wants PowerBall numbers, call the generate_powerball_numbers function.

If the user responds affirmatively, the generate_powerball_numbers function is called to produce a set of PowerBall numbers.
Display the generated PowerBall numbers to the user.

The generated PowerBall numbers are displayed to the user using a formatted string.
If the user does not want PowerBall numbers, display a corresponding message.

If the user responds negatively, a message is displayed, indicating that they can try generating PowerBall numbers another time.
Define the main function to encapsulate the program logic.

The main function is where the overall logic of the program is defined. It orchestrates the user interaction and calls relevant functions.
Run the main function if the script is executed directly.

The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures that the main function is executed only if the script is run as the main program, not when it's imported as a module. This is a common Python idiom.
